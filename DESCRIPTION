Description: Tools for calculating disclosure risk measures for microdata,
    including record-level and file-level measures. The record-level disclosure
    risk is estimated primarily using exhaustive tabulation. The file-level
    disclosure risk is estimated by fitting loglinear models on the observed 
    sample counts in cells formed by key variables and their interactions.

    Shlomo (2008) <doi:10.1198/016214507000001328> for a description of the
    file-level risk measures and the loglinear model approach.
